# v1.0.4 Go SDK

Release date: `2026-03-29`

## Read This Release If

- you consume the Go SDK as a normal public Go module
- you are upgrading an older Go integration and want the first truthful module-path fix
- you need one short note to justify moving away from `replace`-style workarounds

## Why This Patch Matters

This patch made the public Go SDK module path truthful for normal Go consumption.

## What Changed

- the Go SDK module root moved from `sdk/plugin-kit-ai/` to `sdk/`
- the public module path `github.com/777genius/plugin-kit-ai/sdk` now matches the real repo layout
- starter repos, examples, and templates were updated to stop teaching `replace`-based newcomer workarounds

## Practical Guidance

- use `github.com/777genius/plugin-kit-ai/sdk@v1.0.4` or newer for normal Go module consumption
- treat `v1.0.3` as known-bad for the Go SDK module path

## Read It Through This Lens

- SDK consumer: this is the patch that makes the normal module story finally match the public recommendation.
- Repo owner: use this note if your Go path still carries older workaround assumptions in starters, examples, or internal docs.
- New Go adopter: use this note as the cleanup patch, then pair it with [v1.0.0](/en/releases/v1-0-0) for the broader stable baseline.

## Why Users Should Care

This patch reduced friction for normal Go consumers and made the recommended SDK path look like a normal public module instead of a special-case workaround.

## What To Read Next

- Read [v1.0.0](/en/releases/v1-0-0) for the first stable public baseline.
- Read [Go SDK](/en/api/go-sdk/) for the live generated SDK surface.
- Read [Version And Compatibility Policy](/en/reference/version-and-compatibility) if you want the compact rule for releases, baselines, and compatibility.
